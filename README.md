# mqtt-client

Gateway connecting different Protocols and Devices via MQTT

This works perfectly together with <b>Home Assistant</b>

Currently it is very sloppy programmed (created my first python skills on this many years ago)

It supports following modules:

* Relayboards (ETH008)
* Enocean (with the Enocean Pi Module)
* GPIO (normal GPIO Pins on Pi)
* Sonar (Distance sensor with sound)
* Victron Energy MQTT Gateway

The Code will run on all architectures but Enocean and GPIO only work on armhf and arm64.

Help is appreciated!
